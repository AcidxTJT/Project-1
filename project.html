      AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), <br>
      recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix),<br>
      understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),<br>
      self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo),<br>
      generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and<br>
      competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).</div>

<h2><font size="26">ChatGPT</font></h2>
<div class="content">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7" align="right">&#10022;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a>, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer,<br>
      is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022,<br>
      notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language used.<br>
      Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.<br>
      ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 —members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models,<br>
      based on the transformer architecture developed by Google and<br>
      it is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.<br>
      ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version.<br>
      In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4 based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name "ChatGPT Plus".<br></div>

    <div class="col-sm-8">&#10022;ChatGPT works by attempting to understand your prompt and then spitting out strings of words that it predicts will best answer your question,<br>
      based on the data it was trained on.Let's actually talk about that training.<br>
      It's a process where the nascent AI is given some ground rules, and<br>
      then it's either put in situations or given loads of data to work through in order to develop its own algorithms.<br>
      GPT-3 was trained on roughly 500 billion "tokens," which allow its language models to more easily assign meaning and<br>
      predict plausible follow-on text. Many words map to single tokens, though longer or more complex words often break down into multiple tokens.<br>
      On average, tokens are roughly four characters long. OpenAI has stayed quiet about the inner workings of GPT-4,<br>
      but we can safely assume it was trained on much the same dataset since it's even more powerful.<br></div>

  </div>
    <div class="col-8" id="content3_col2">The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and can revolutionize any professional sector. Let’s see some of them<br>
                       1) Reduction in Human Error:<br>
                       The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly.<br>
                       With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms.So errors are reduced and<br>
                       the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.<br>
                       Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>
                       2) Takes risks instead of Humans:<br>
                       This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot<br>
                       which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil,<br>
                       it can be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.<br>
                       Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in Ukraine?<br>
                       At that time there were no AI-powered robots that can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by controlling the fire in early stages,<br>
                       as any human went close to the core was dead in a matter of minutes. They eventually poured sand and boron from helicopters from a mere distance.<br>
                       AI Robots can be used in such situations where intervention can be hazardous.<br><br>
                       3) Available 24x7:<br>
                       An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves<br>
                       and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life.<br>
                       But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.<br>
                       Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.<br><br>
                       4) Helping in Repetitive Jobs:<br>
                       In our day-to-day work, we will be performing many repetitive works like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors and many more things.<br>
                       Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.<br>
                       Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank.<br>
                       Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying the documents by which both the customers and the owner will be benefited.<br><br>
                       5) Digital Assistance:<br>
                       Some of the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to interact with users which saves the need for human resources.<br>
                       The digital assistants also used in many websites to provide things that users want. We can chat with them about what we are looking for.<br>
                       Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it’s become hard to determine that we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being.<br>
                       Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team that needs to clarify the doubts and queries of the customers.<br>
                       Using AI the organizations can set up a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help customers with all their queries.<br>
                       We can see many organizations already started using them on their websites and mobile applications.<br><br>
                       6) Faster Decisions:<br>
                       Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker.<br>
                       While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically<br>
                       but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way.<br>
                       Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that game.<br>
                       It will take the best possible step in a very short time according to the algorithms used behind it.<br>
                       7) Daily Applications:<br>
                       Daily applications such as Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, Google’s OK Google are frequently used in our daily routine whether it is for searching a location,<br>
                       taking a selfie, making a phone call, replying to a mail and many more.<br>
                       Example: Around 20 years ago, when we are planning to go somewhere we used to ask a person who already went there for the directions.<br>
                       But now all we have to do is say “OK Google where is Visakhapatnam”.<br>
                       It will show you Visakhapatnam’s location on google map and the best path between you and Visakhapatnam.<br><br>
                       8) New Inventions:<br>
                       AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help humans solve the majority of complex problems.<br><br></div>
        <div class="col-8"  id="content3_col2" align="right">As every bright side has a darker version in it. Artificial Intelligence also has some disadvantages. Let’s see some of them<br>
                     1) High Costs of Creation:<br>
                     As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements.<br>
                     Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty of costs. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.<br><br>
                     2) Making Humans Lazy:<br>
                     AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work.<br>
                     Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations.<br><br>
                     3) Unemployment:<br>
                     As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots,<br>
                     human interference is becoming less which will cause a major problem in the employment standards.<br>
                     Every organization is looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with AI robots which can do similar work with more efficiency.<br><br>
                     4) No Emotions:<br>
                     There is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiently but they cannot replace the human connection that makes the team.<br>
                     Machines cannot develop a bond with humans which is an essential attribute when comes to Team Management.<br><br>
                     5) Lacking Out of Box Thinking:<br>
                     Machines can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed to do,<br>
                     anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.<br><br></div>
